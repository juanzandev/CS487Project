# 🔧 Executable Theme Change Fix

## ✅ **Issue Resolved**

The `_MEI temporary directory` error when changing themes in the executable has been **FIXED**!

## 🐛 **What Was the Problem?**

When running the Canvas Grade Widget as a PyInstaller executable, changing themes would cause:

```
Failed to remove temporary directory _MEI330842
```

This happened because:

1. PyInstaller creates temporary directories (`_MEI*`) when the executable runs
2. The restart mechanism was trying to run `sys.executable` which pointed to the temp directory
3. Windows couldn't clean up the temp directory while it was still being referenced

## 🛠️ **The Fix**

Modified `restart_application()` method in `SettingsDialog` to:

```python
def restart_application(self, main_widget):
    """Restart the application to apply theme changes"""
    import subprocess
    import sys

    # Close the current application
    main_widget.close()

    # Determine if we're running from an executable or script
    if getattr(sys, 'frozen', False):
        # Running from PyInstaller executable
        executable_path = sys.executable
        subprocess.Popen([executable_path], cwd=os.path.dirname(executable_path))
    else:
        # Running from Python script
        subprocess.Popen([sys.executable, "canvas_grade_widget.py"],
                        cwd=os.getcwd())

    # Exit current instance with a small delay to ensure cleanup
    QTimer.singleShot(500, QApplication.instance().quit)
```

### **Key Changes:**

1. **Detection**: Check if running from executable using `getattr(sys, 'frozen', False)`
2. **Proper Path**: Use `sys.executable` directly for executables (not temp directory)
3. **Working Directory**: Set proper working directory using `os.path.dirname(executable_path)`
4. **Cleanup Delay**: Added 500ms delay before quit to ensure proper cleanup

## 🎉 **Result**

✅ **Theme changes now work perfectly in the executable!**
✅ **No more temporary directory errors**
✅ **Smooth restart experience**
✅ **Works for both .exe and .py versions**

## 📦 **Updated Executable**

The fix is included in:

- `CanvasGradeWidget_v2.exe` (latest version with fix)
- All future builds will include this fix

## 🧪 **Testing**

To test the fix:

1. Run `CanvasGradeWidget_v2.exe`
2. Right-click → Settings
3. Change theme (e.g., Light → Dark)
4. Click "Save Changes"
5. App should restart smoothly with new theme applied!
